	<h1>All About Kylie </h1>
	
	<a href="DigitalDesign.html">Digital Design</a>

<p> Hello, my name is <em>Kylie</em> and I am currently a junior at <strong>BECA</strong>. I will use this opportunity to let you know a few things about myself</p> 

<br>

<h2> Hobbies </h2>

<p> I enjoy reading comics and novels, as well as sometimes drawing. Drawing and writing are both expressive which is why I enjoy them so much. Most of the day, I'll be listening to music as that just became a part of my daily life, and truthfully something that is a necessity. </p> 

<h3> Interests </h3>

<p> Interests differ a bit from my hobbies depending on which aspect I'm talking about. In this case I have a lot of interest in <em>psychology</em>, and it is what I plan to major in when I go off to university. Studying the human mind and its emotions and the reasoning why some things function the way they do, the reactions it brings out of a person and how it ties together just fascinates me. Though crimes, more specifically <em>forensic psychology</em>, is also quite interest because it brings the element of crime.
