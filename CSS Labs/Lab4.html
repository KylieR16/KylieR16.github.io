<span>The world is a giant system
<br>
In it, either opposition, war, or survival is inserted
<br>
Life that we can't refuse
<br>
With dreams as its collateral, the capitalism injects the morphine called 'hope'
<br>
Wealth breeds wealth and tests greed
<br>
The rich longs even for poverty
<br>
In the world there's only black and white, those two
<br>
In an endless zero-sum game, the very end is worth seeing
<br>
Polarization is the ugliest flower in the world
<br>
It's been long since the truth's been eaten away by the lies
<br>
Who benefits the most?
<br>
  Just who suffers damage the most? </span>
